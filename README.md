hmud
====

A MUD in Haskell. At least, that's the goal; presently all I have here is just the beginnings of a one-player text adventure game.

To play the game on a Mac:

1. Download the Haskell Platform for Mac: http://www.haskell.org/platform/mac.html

2. Open Terminal, navigate to the project root directory and run the following command: ````./runmefirst.sh````

3. Run the following command: ````runghc Mud/Main.hs````
